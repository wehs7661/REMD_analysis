## Description
`REMD_analysis` is a Python package of data analysis tools for replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations.

## Installation and Testing
All the Python scripts in this package are written in Python 3. Currently the package can be installed by following the commands below:
```
git clone https://github.com/wehs7661/REMD_analysis.git
cd REMD_analysis
pip install -e .
```
To perform the unit tests and functional tests (still underdevelopment) of this package, run:
```
python test_REMD_analysis.py    ; unit tests
python test_REMD_analysis.sh    ; functional tests
```

## Usage

### 1. Prepartion of simulation input files 
This package provides a simple way to prepare simulations input files (such as `.mdp` and `.tpr` files for each replica) for Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations and submitting jobs to Summit or Bridges. By running the command `bash HREMD.sh`, the following promopts will be invoked for the user to specify relevant paramters:
```
This shell script prepares all the files needed to run a Hamiltonian replica exchange including .mdp files and .tpr files, given the common .gro file and a template .mdp file. A job submission script will also be generated.
Please input the name of the job: 
Please input the prefix of the file names: 
Please input the number of replicas: 
Please input the number of requested nodes: 
Please input the simulation time (in hour): 
Will the job be submitted to Summit or Bridges?
```
The script for preparing temperature replica exchange simulations are currently under development.

### 2. `REMD_analysis.py`: Visualization of transition/overlap matrices and state-time plot 

- The main program of this package, `REMD_anaysis.py`, is able to analyze the log files from a replica exchange simulation and perform the following tasks:

  - Plot the exploration of states as a function of time for each replica.
  - Visualize the transition matrix between differen replicas as a heat map, no matter the simulation reaches the time frame specified in the `mdp` or not.
  - **(Under development)** Given the `*dhdl.xvg` files from the simulation, this script is also able to perform free energy calculations using Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio ([MBAR](https://github.com/choderalab/pymbar)). For the documentation of `pymbar`, which is the implementation of MBAR, replease refer to [Dr. Chodera's GitHub repository](https://pymbar.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
  - **(Under development)** Similarly, with `*dhdl.xvg` files, the script is able to visualize the overlap matrix between different thermodynamic states.

 - To check the required inputs, outpus and the description of the code, run `REMD_analysis -h`.

 - Ideally, the code is able to find the `log` file to be analyzed and identify the common prefix of the simulation files without any flags specified. Therefore, to run the program, simply run `REMD_anlysis`.  
 - For example, two figures as shown below can be generated by running `REMD_analysis` upon the example file `PLCpep7.log` provided in the folder `REMD_analysis/examples`.
   - Exploration of states as a function of time

   - Visuazliation of the transition matrix

- Also, the `STDOUT` of the command above would be:
 ```
